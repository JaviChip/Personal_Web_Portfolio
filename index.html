                <p> Hello there! I'm Javier Becerril, and when it comes to all things computer science, I've got a 
                    intrest for web development and mobile development. I'm on a mission to become a well-rounded 
                    software engineer, hopefully learning as much as I can for full-stack development. 
                    Right now, I have been introduced to databases and the utility it provides for most if not all
                    applications. Neverthless, besides CS , I am passionate about skateboarding. It's taught me valuable lessons in
                    determination and sticking with something no matter how hard it can get. I am also into fashion
                    and music which a lot of the times go hand in hand.</p>
